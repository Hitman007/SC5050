As a the system
I want to purchase tickets

PISQ = product inventory stock quantity
PRTN = physical raffle ticket number

Feature PRTN

When a user purchases a Raffle Ticket Product
Then PRTNs are assigned to each order, per quantity.
And PRTNs are emailed to the customer with their confirmation email.

The system should control the PISQ available for purchase in Woo commerce.

The normal default Woocommerce PISQ controller is disabled.
