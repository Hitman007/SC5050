ATURE: Admin manages tickets from the post.php edit screen

PRTN = physical raffle ticket number
A PRTN is a number that comes from a physical piece of paper that the user has purchased seperately
in a physical brick and mortar raffle supply store. It is both that number written on a piece of paper
and a data object assigned to a PRTNTicket CPT.

AS an admin
I want to manage tickets from the post.php edit screen
SO that I can remove tickets from available tickets sold

GIVEN there is a custom post type called "Raffle"
GIVEN there is a product called "Raffle Ticket Product"
GIVEN there is a CPT type called "PRTNTicket"
